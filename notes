How do i change an object in a state using setState
this.state = {concept: {a:b, b:c}, c:d}
this.setState({concept[a]: z }) <- this doesn't work
can do this:
const newConcept = Object.assign({}, this.state.concept, {[field]: e.target.value});
this.setState({concept: newConcept});

NEVER EVER LET 1 COMPONENT CHANGE ANOTHER COMPONENT's STATE!!!!!!
